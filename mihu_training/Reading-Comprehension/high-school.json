        "text_name" : "Abigail Adams: Persuading Her Husband",
        "description" : "Abigail Adams (1744-1818) was the wife of Founding Father John Adams. While he attended the Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1776, Abigail wrote to her husband often. Below is part of her letter from March 31, 1776.",
        "text": "I long to hear that you have declared an independency. And, by the way, in the new code of laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make, I desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands. Remember, all men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation. That your sex are naturally tyrannical is a truth so thoroughly established as to admit of no dispute; but such of you as wish to be happy willingly give up the harsh title of master for the more tender and endearing one of friend. Why, then, not put it out of the power of the vicious and the lawless to use us with cruelty and indignity with impunity? Men of sense in all ages abhor those customs which treat us only as the vassals of your sex; regard us then as beings placed by Providence under your protection, and in imitation of the Supreme Being make use of that power only for our happiness.",
        "answer" : "Abigail Adams is attempting to convince her husband, John Adams, to remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable towards them in the new code of laws he will create. Two examples of how she attempts to persuade him are: 1. She appeals to his sense of fairness by pointing out that if men were given unlimited power without any checks, they would become tyrants. She is essentially saying that it's only fair to give women a voice and representation in the new code of laws. 2. She uses emotional appeal by suggesting that if he treats her and other women with kindness and respect, she will willingly relinquish the title of 'master' for the more tender and endearing one of 'friend'. This shows that she is willing to work together with him and find a mutually beneficial solution.",
        "correction1" : "Absolutely right! I would give this answer a 9.5/10. If you want to level it up a bit, you could also mention how she subtly threatens rebellion",
        "answer1" : "Thank you for the feedback. You're right; Abigail Adams does subtly threaten rebellion by stating that if particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, they are 'determined to foment a rebellion' and will not hold themselves bound by any laws in which they have no voice or representation. This adds an element of urgency and consequences to her appeal. I'll make sure to incorporate this nuance into my future responses. Thank you for helping me improve! (And I'm glad to hear that my initial answer was close enough to earn a 9.5/10!)"

        "text1" : "U.S. Constitution, Article One, Section 2 (1789) Clause 3: Apportionment of Representatives and taxes Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fi fths of all other Persons....",
        "text2" : "Amendment XIII (1865) Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.",
        "text3" : "Amendment XIV (1868) Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.",
        "question" : "Analyze these three parts of the U.S. Constitution. How do they address slavery?",
        "answer" : "Let me take a closer look at these three parts of the U.S. Constitution. Article One, Section 2, Clause 3 (1789) addresses slavery by allowing representatives and direct taxes to be apportioned among states based on their respective numbers, which includes 'those bound to Service for a Term of Years' – in other words, slaves. This provision effectively institutionalized slavery within the United States. Amendment XIII (1865), Section 1, abolishes slavery by stating that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United States or any place subject to its jurisdiction, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted. This amendment formally ended the institution of slavery in the United States. Amendment XIV (1868), Section 1, addresses slavery by declaring that all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. It also prohibits states from making or enforcing any law that abridges the privileges or immunities of citizens, deprives any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or denies anyone within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. In summary, these three parts of the U.S. Constitution address slavery by initially institutionalizing it (Article One), then abolishing it (Amendment XIII), and finally prohibiting states from denying citizens their rights based on previous slave status (Amendment XIV).",
        "correction" : "Perfect again, Mihu. Just make one tiny adjustment. In the first article, Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 (1789) You wrote: “...allowing representatives and direct taxes to be apportioned among states... which includes ‘those bound to Service for a Term of Years’—in other words, slaves.” This is correct. It’s referring to the Three-Fifths Compromise, where enslaved people were counted as three-fifths of a person for taxation and representation. Tiny refinement: the phrase “those bound to Service for a Term of Years” actually refers to indentured servants, not enslaved people — the part that says “three-fifths of all other persons” is what refers to enslaved people. So you could tweak that to make it razor-sharp accurate",
        "answer1" : "Here's the revised analysis: Article One, Section 2, Clause 3 (1789) addresses slavery by allowing representatives and direct taxes to be apportioned among states based on their respective numbers, which includes 'those bound to Service for a Term of Years' – in other words, indentured servants. The phrase 'three-fifths of all other persons' refers specifically to enslaved people. This provision effectively institutionalized the Three-Fifths Compromise, which counted enslaved individuals as three-fifths of a person for taxation and representation purposes. The rest of my analysis remains unchanged."

        "text_name" : "Mark Antony’s Oration from Julius Caesar",
        "description" : "In William Shakespeare’s play, Julius Caesar, Caesar has been assassinated in front of the Senate by a group of Roman offi cials, including his friend, Brutus. After the murder, Brutus speaks to the gathered crowd. He convinces them that the conspirators killed Caesar to save Rome. Mark Antony is another Roman offi cial and friend to Caesar who did not participate in the murder. Antony promises Brutus that he will not blame the conspirators if he is allowed to make a speech also.",
        "text" : "Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones: So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious: If it were so, it was a grievous fault; And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,— For Brutus is an honourable man; So are they all, all honorable men,— Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me: But Brutus says he was ambitious; And Brutus is an honourable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept: Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; And Brutus is an honourable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; And, sure, he is an honourable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause: What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him? O judgment, thou art fl ed to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason! Bear with me; My heart is in the coffi n there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me.",
        "answer" : "The point Antony is trying to convey to the audience is that Caesar was not ambitious and that Brutus' justification for killing him is flawed. He aims to persuade the crowd that Caesar was a just and fair leader, and that his assassination is unjustified. Antony develops his point by using several rhetorical strategies: 1. **Contrast**: Antony juxtaposes the idea of Caesar being ambitious with the reality of Caesar's actions, showing how he helped the poor and wept for them when they cried. This contrast highlights the inaccuracy of Brutus' claim. 2. **Emotional appeal**: Antony appeals to the audience's emotions by reminding them of their shared love for Caesar and asking why they should mourn his death. He also expresses his own emotional pain, saying his heart is in the coffin with Caesar. This creates empathy and makes the audience more receptive to his message. 3. **Irony**: Antony uses irony when he says that Brutus is an honorable man, implying that this honorability does not justify murder. He also questions whether Brutus' claim of ambition is true, given Caesar's refusal of a kingly crown. 4. **Rhetorical repetition**: Antony repeats the phrase 'Yet Brutus says he was ambitious' to emphasize the inconsistency between Brutus' words and reality. This repetition also creates a sense of rhythm, making his speech more engaging and memorable. By using these strategies, Antony skillfully develops his point and persuades the audience that Caesar's assassination is unjustified.",
        "notes" : "Amazing. 10/10 tier analysis. She showed understanding of both what Antony says and how he says it, backed it with textual evidence, and broke it into clear rhetorical techniques. That’s genuinely college-level reading comprehension right there."
